The task is to create a Python program that will withdraw money from a bank account by accepting the Debit Card number, CVV, Expiry Month, Expiry Year, and Amount to be withdrawn. The program will then check whether the Debit Card is valid and has not expired, and whether the amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to the available balance in the account. If the conditions are satisfied, the program will deduct the amount from the respective account and store the after update changes of the hdfc table in the hdfc_transaction_logs. The bank table will have Account Number, Name, Address, Balance, Phone, Email, Branch Code, and Security Code. The Debit Card Table will have Debit Card Number, Account Number, CVV, Name, Expiry Month, and Expiry Year.
